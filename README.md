Implementing various ML methods to predict play types in the NFL

Abstract:

This paper aims to develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict plays (pass versus rush) in the National Football League that will be useful for players and coaches in real time. Using data from the 2013–2014 to 2016–2017 NFL regular seasons, which included 1034 games and 130,344 pass/rush plays, we first develop and compare several machine learning models to determine the maximum possible prediction accuracy. The best performing model, a neural network, achieves a prediction accuracy of 75.3%, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods applied to other datasets. Then, we search over a family of simple decision tree models to identify one that captures 86% of the prediction accuracy of the neural network yet can be easily memorized and implemented in an actual game. We extend the analysis to building decision tree models tailored for each of the 32 NFL teams, obtaining accuracies ranging from 64.7% to 82.5%. Overall, our decision tree models can be a useful tool for coaches and players to improve their chances of stopping an offensive play.
